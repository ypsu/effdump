# effdump

effdump is a Go module to generate and diff textual effects across git commits.
See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ypsu/effdump for the documentation.

Note: this project uses https://ypsu.github.io/featver as its versioning scheme.
The project will enter the more stable v1 version only when it has users already.
