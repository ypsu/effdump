- edmain: add a diffkeys subcommand to list all keys with diffs to avoid the need for a new flag to control when "(xx more entries)" is displayed
- webdiff: make the selection work correctly
- fmtdiff: add SetHunkHeaderREs(regexps []*RegExp): earlier regexps are higher priority; just take the latest highest priority regex as the hunk line
- edmain: add a README to the tmpdir similar to /tmp/cache/go-build/README
- edmain: add auto-trimming: if lasttrim is older than a day, delete dumps older than 8 days and touch lasttrim
- unidiff: colorize output; -color is by default true iff os.Stdout is terminal or -watcherPID is set
- examples: add a markdown example too
- flag: add -template=key flag for choosing a "template" to use on lhs side for new rhs keys instead of the empty value
