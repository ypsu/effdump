- edmain: add a diffkeys subcommand to list all keys with diffs to avoid the need for a new flag to control when "(xx more entries)" is displayed
- edmain: add a README to the tmpdir similar to /tmp/cache/go-build/README
- edmain: implement webprint; just something barebones because terminals can be awkward for large output
- unidiff: colorize output; -color is by default true iff os.Stdout is terminal or -watcherPID is set
- examples: add a markdown example too
- flag: add -template=key flag for choosing a "template" to use on lhs side for new rhs keys instead of the empty value
