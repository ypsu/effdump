- test: add a dup test, same as "no args" but with "even" added to the entries again
- print: add simple globbing support (do this instead of regexes; rewrite glob to regex via the help of regexp.quotemeta)
- compress: avoid rewriting if the hash of the dump is the same; read hash from gzip header
- stringify: json pretty print everything except for stringers and strings
- edmain: add a clean command that deletes everything from the target directory
- fmtdiff: add SetHunkHeaderRE(re string) error and SetHunkHeaderREs(keyglob, re ...string) error (default could be ^\S)
- examples: add a markdown example too
- dump: add a hash() function as a convenience
- flag: add -template=key flag for choosing a "template" to use on lhs side for new rhs keys instead of the empty value
